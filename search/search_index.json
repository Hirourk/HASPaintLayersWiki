Understanding HAS Paint Layers HAS Paint Layers is a material setup add-on designed to simplify the process of creating node groups and configuring a basic shader. It automates the initial steps required for painting and texture creation, making it faster to get started with your project. Each layer added through HAS Paint Layers represents a texture, color or node. All is stored within the Blender scene. This means you can manage, re-use, and export textures as needed for other parts of your workflow. Important Note on Node Groups Avoid editing the node groups created by HAS Paint Layers . Directly modifying these node groups can result in unexpected errors or could lead to the overwriting of any custom changes you've made.

By default, it affects the Diffuse channel, but you can change this to target other channels as needed. Fill Layer The Fill Layer is a layer with a color input, ideal for quickly filling areas, applying solid colors, or configuring specific channels. PBR Layer The PBR Layer is designed to allow painting across multiple channels that are commonly used in physically based rendering (PBR). You can paint details for channels like Diffuse, Metallic, Roughness, Normal, Height, etc that can be defined in Material Settings Folder Layer The Folder Layer is used for organizing and managing multiple layers. You can group related layers under a folder to keep your project organized. Filters added will be applied to all layers in this folder. Layer Textures In HAS Paint , paint layers are represented by textures. The textures created with this add-on have the following properties: Alpha Premultiplied : All textures have alpha premultiplication, meaning that transparency is accounted for color values, which helps ensure proper blending of textures. Can be changed in Layer Actions Color sRGB : The textures use sRGB color space, which gives accurate color representation and blending in the 3D viewport. Can be changed in Layer Actions All new textures are created with a default size of 1024x1024 pixels unless changed in the Material Settings . Layer Layout Each layer has properties that allow you to control its behavior and appearance: Image/Color Preview : Layer image preview or Color property that can be edited if no image assigned Select Layer : Select layer for painting and editing properties/filters/sub-layers. Opacity Control : Adjust the opacity of the layer to blend it with layers below. Blending Mode : Set the blending mode (e.g., Mix, Multiply, Overlay) to control how the layer interacts with those beneath it. Visibility : Toggle the visibility of the layer to hide or show it as needed. Layer Name : Visible name for layer. Layer Actions : Operations with layer.

Filters can be added through the action menu, and they serve as a way to manipulate the textures directly, giving you greater control over the final look of your materials. Adding a filter to a layer results in a few noticeable changes. The layer will now be marked with a filter icon, and selecting the layer will reveal a column with all the filters that have been assigned. Filters list Applying Levels Applying Mask and Light filter Filter Levels This filter allows you to control the levels of an RGB image, with controls similar to those found in image editing software. It also has the option to display a histogram of the current image by updating the histogram. Color Ramp Helps adjust the image contrast or adds color to a black and white image. It is useful for creating artistic effects or emphasizing specific tones. Curve Allows control over the colors of an image using RGB curves. This is useful for fine-tuning the brightness, contrast, and color balance of the layer. HSV Uses a **Hue Saturation Value** node to adjust these properties of the image. This filter is useful for color manipulation, such as shifting hues or changing overall saturation. Invert Inverts the color values of the image, effectively creating a negative effect. This filter can add interesting visual effects or be used in masking techniques. Gamma Controls the gamma of the current layer. It allows you to adjust the midtones without affecting highlights and shadows too much. Brightness Contrast Adjusts the brightness and contrast of the current layer. It is simple but effective for balancing the look of your textures. Paint Layer This filter allows adding a simple paint layer to the existing layer. Mask By Color Selects specific colors in the image to mask. This is useful for isolating and editing areas based on their color properties. Mask Generator Generates a mask using grunge textures and realtime or baked maps such as Ambient Occlusion (AO), Curvature, or Position. Light Fake light based on geometry or baked Object Normal Map Blur Takes a snapshot of the current layer and creates a blurred image. Snapshot Takes a snapshot of the current layer, allowing you to reuse it in other parts of your workflow. It essentially saves the layer state so you can apply it elsewhere. Transform Translates, scales, or rotates the current layer. This filter allows you to manipulate the positioning of your texture without manually adjusting UVs. Custom Filter Allows for the use of a custom node group, created by users. It should have at least one input and output. The add-on automatically displays all input sockets, enabling users to edit properties and change inputs as needed.

Choose which maps to bake from the list below: Ambient Occlusion The Ambient Occlusion map uses a shader setup that is assigned to source object, you can control the AO distance in settings for this map. This method provides a fast and noise-free AO map. Curvature To bake Curvature, the add-on uses a shader and geometry nodes setup that applies directly to the source object. In settings for this map you can use Subdivision slider, to find what is best for you. Be causios with high subdivision as it can crash or take a long time to process. Object Normal The Object Normal map uses a shader setup that is assigned to source object. Creates normalized World/Object Normal Map. Object Position The Object Position map uses a shader setup that is assigned to source object. Creates normalized Object Position map. Height The Height map utilizes a geometry group assigned to source object to calculate the height difference between the high-poly and low-poly meshes. This allows you to bake height data without needing to use tessellation, keeping performance efficient. Requires Source(High) Object Diffuse The Diffuse map is captured from source object material. Requires Source(High) Object Emission The Emission map is captured from source object material.

This feature helps prevent loss of textures if Blender shuts down unexpectedly. Export Textures HAS Paint allows you to export created textures as individual images or as an ORA (Open Raster Archive) file. ORA is an open-source layer file format compatible with programs like Krita and other open-source graphic editors. Export options and template example Each map can be packed using different channels. For example you can create RMO(Rougness, Metallic, Occlusion) using R+G+B+A. To export your textures, follow these steps: Navigate to the File menu on top of the addon. Click on the Export Textures button, which will open the path selection window. Choose a name for your export. Use presets or create new, for different channels as needed. Save presets for easy reuse in future projects. Naming Conventions You can use specific properties in the naming to ensure consistency: Allowed properties: (obj) , (mtl) , (file) , (set) Example: (obj)_Diffuse will be saved as YourObject_Diffuse . Example 2: (obj)_(mtl)_(file)_(set)_D will be saved as Cube_Material_Untitled_Set01_D . This flexibility helps you maintain a clean and consistent file structure, especially in projects with multiple objects and textures. Export ORA When exporting as an ORA file, be aware of certain limitations: - All layer filters, masks, and other data will be collapsed into a single image. - Images will be exported while maintaining blending modes and opacity . However, Passthrough and Normal blend modes will be converted to Mix Blending .
