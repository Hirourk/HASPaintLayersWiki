**HAS Paint** is a free tool for artists who want a non-destructive workflow with textures. It is especially well-suited for artists focusing on **hand-painted textures** and **fast editing**, while still being highly effective for creating **PBR (Physically Based Rendering) textures**. It provides layers, paint tools, fast baking, filters, and more.
